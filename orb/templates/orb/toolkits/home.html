<h3>{% trans 'Making Content Meaningful: A Guide to Adapting Existing Global Health Content for Different Audiences' %}</h3></a>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}The abundance of openly accessible health content—from eLearning courses and multimedia resources to guidance documents and research papers—presents a remarkable opportunity for teaching, learning, and
sharing. Open health content, however, is not sufficient by itself. It is important to provide it in the appropriate context and the language of the people who will use it. The Knowledge for Health 
(K4Health)project developed this adaptation guide to expand the reach, usefulness, and use of evidence-based global health content,	specifically as it relates to family planning. The guide outlines a
framework with key steps and questions for consideration as well as	activity sheets and an illustrative as well as real-life case studies that will help a user in making informed decisions in the content
adaptation process.{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}The Community Health Framework assists non-technical audiences in understanding community health and how it can be strengthened. An	interactive power point, published under a Creative Commons license, it
depicts the community health ecosystem as heath-specific and health-enabling actors and structures (formal and informal) working together to ensure that each has the agency, access, and resources to
ensure the health of community members. It also includes a Toolkit with	models and case studies as examples of good practice.{% endblocktrans %}

<p>
{% blocktrans %}The Principles for Digital Development (in English, Español, Français, or Português) find their roots in the efforts of individuals, development organizations, and donors alike who have called for a more
concerted effort by donors and implementing partners to	institutionalize lessons learned in the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in development projects. They were	written by and 
for international development donors and their implementing partners, but are freely available for use by all. ThePrinciples are intended to serve as guidance rather than edict, and to be updated and 
refined over time.{% endblocktrans %}

<h3>{% trans 'Financing Framework to End Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD)' %}</h3></a>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The U.S. Government is committed to achieving the once unimaginable goal of Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD) by 2035. Achieving this goal in a sustainable fashion implies a
gradual move toward solutions that mobilize both domestic and international resources, with the objective of putting developing	country health systems on a trajectory toward financial sustainability.{% endblocktrans %}

<p>{% blocktrans %}The Financing Framework is designed to outline ways in which	additional financial resources and tools can be utilized to support	sustainability. The Framework draws on inspiration from best practices
used throughout the U.S. Agency for International Development and with our health partners around the world.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Using Resources on ORB' %}</h3>

{% blocktrans with settings.ORB_INFO_EMAIL as email %}
<p>Once you've found the resources you're looking for, each resource will have at least one download or web link option. Use these to save the resource onto your laptop or 
   mobile device. You can use the resources for your own study or integrate them into a  training program or workshop.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for how you could use the content in your training program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the videos onto SD cards, to distribute to health workers to watch on their mobile devices</li>
<li>Integrate the resources into a mobile learning or eLearning training courses</li>
<li>Use as teaching aids in classroom or in-person courses</li>
<li>Use the videos with community members to help reinforce health messages (for example about handwashing, or breastfeeding)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use ORB resources to create a structured, mobile-enabled training course. The <a href="http://open-deliver.org">Open Deliver</a> process can help you select, structure, 
   and deliver mobile content to health workers.</p> 

<p>We'd love to hear from you about how you've used the ORB resources. If you have a story to share, <a href="mailto:{{ email }}">please contact us</a>.</p>

Resource Management

Remove/Hide a resource
-------------------------

Usually it will be best to just hide a resource, rather than delete it, since deleting it will remove all of the statistics and other information that is associated with a resource.

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the ORB section select 'Resources'
* Search or browse for the resource and click to edit the details
* Change the status to either 'pending', 'rejected' or 'archived' ('archived' option coming soon)
* Click save

To completely delete the resource, from the edit page, there is an option to delete the resource.

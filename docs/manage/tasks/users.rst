User/Permissions Management
=============================

.. _faqSearchUser:

Search for a user
-------------------

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the Authentication and Authorization section select 'Users'
* You can search based on name, username or email address

.. _faqUpdateUser:

Update a users information/change password
--------------------------------------------

* Find the user you'd like to update (:ref:`faqSearchUser`)
* Click to edit their details
* From here you can update their information and change their password
* Click save when finished


.. _faqContentReviewer:

Add a new content reviewer
----------------------------

The new reviewer should register on ORB first and let us have their username so we can then assign them permissions.

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the ORB section select 'User profiles'
* Search or browse for the user and click to edit their details
* Under the reviewer roles, select the role(s) to give this user
* Click 'save'

.. _faqOrganisationAnalytics: 

Give access to organisation analytics
---------------------------------------

Users can be given permissions to view the analytics for all the resources published under their organisations.

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the ORB section select 'Tag Owners'
* Click on 'Add tag owner' and select the user and tag to give permissions to, then save

Usually we'd give users access to tags that are organisations, although you could assign users to any tag.


.. _faqContentReviewers:

View Content Reviewers
----------------------------

If you need to find out who is currently listed as being a content reviewer, and for which roles:

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the ORB section select 'User profiles'
* From the filtering menu on the right hand side, you can filter the users by the reviewer roles

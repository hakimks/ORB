Add a new health domain
-------------------------

* Go to the ORB admin pages
* Under the ORB section select 'Tags'
* Select 'Add Tag' button (top right of screen)
* For the category, select 'health domain'
* Add the name of the new name in both the 'name' and 'name [en]' fields
* Select your user id as both the create and update user
* Update the 'order by' field to reflect where in the list of health domains you would like the new 
  one to appear - if you are placing it between existing domains, you should also update the order by 
  for the existing domains to ensure consistency in display.
* Untick the 'published' checkbox if you would like to add some resources to the domain before it 
  appears on the homepage. Once you are ready to publish the domain, just tick this box.
* Click 'save'
